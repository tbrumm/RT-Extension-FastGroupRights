%# January 2008.  To speed up this screen, we no longer simply
%#   gather all user-defined groups and figure out the acls for each  
%#   group one by one. Instead, we initially just query the ACL table
%#   to determine user-defined groups that have access to this queue
%#   and we cache them.
%#   So the initial display shows only groups that have access.
%#   To show groups that don't currently have access, we included
%#   a group search control. If the user searches for groups, we
%#   gather these groups and add them to the cache.
