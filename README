ATTENTION: This is from RT 4 not needed anymore. Use only for older RT Versions!

NAME
  RT::Extension::FastGroupRights - Attention: This is obsolete from RT 4.+

DESCRIPTION
  Based on an original Idea from Stephen Turner (MIT) this Extension changes
  the handling of Group Rights Settings inside RT.
  All GroupRights.html will be replaced by a local version within this plugin
  to speed up the load of this page.

  Inside larger RT Setups, the GroupRights Page can take a very long time,
  depending of the amount of Groups you have inside your system. This Extension
  only loads the System Groups and Roles by default and gives you a search box
  for your UserDefinedGroups. After granting rights to a UserDefinedGroup,
  this group will also displayed.

  This Extension will work on the following Pages:
  Queue -> GroupRights
  Group -> GroupRights
  CustomField -> GroupRights
  Global -> GroupRights
  RTFM -> Global -> GroupRights
  RTFM -> Class -> GroupRights
  AT -> Global -> GroupRights
  AT -> Types -> GroupRights
  AT -> CustomFields -> GroupRights

INSTALLATION
  1. Run "perl Makefile.PL"

  2. Run "make"

  3. Run "make install" (you may need root permissions)

  4. Additionally, if you're running 3.8, you'll need to add
     "RT::Extension::FastGroupRights" to @Plugins in
     etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm.  For example:
     Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::FastGroupRights RT::FM));

  6. Clear RT's mason cache and restart the web server to make sure the
     extension is incorporated.
